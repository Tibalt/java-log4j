# java-log4j
A demo to show the usage of log4j in java

The jar for log4j2 is copied here so that you could compile and run easily.Sorry that the folder structure is not well organzied but it is a small demo...

The running environment is javac 1.8.0_65 and Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_65-b17). 

The log4j is log4j-2.7.

You can compile by make and run the demo by "./run.sh". And the log level could be changed in line 9 of "config". For example, put "debug" there, run the program and you will see all the messages from "debug" to "error"
